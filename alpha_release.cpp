/* NOTE: This file will be dedicated to the alpha_release of the program
   - alpha_release.cpp will have a focused emphasis on making sure that the data is being read correctly
   - I will be making notes throughout the file if changes are made from the design I made in my pseudo/wirecode file

// SLIGHT IDEA CHANGE: All cards have a different version/rarities of themselves
//  - rarity will not be featured in the data.txt file, but in the main file
//  - will use srand/rand() to create the rarity system within this file 

// SLIGHT CHANGE: Will need to change the way data is collected in order to have an array of lists, 
// OMITTING THE "Krazy_Kreature" class, 
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <list>
#include <string>
#include <random>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

// rewriting the main function
