Bugs/Issues that are encountered, will be noted in this file.

BUG: Trying to run beta_release file with the newly implemented eof if-statement in the "read_kreature" function. 
Currently, it is not reading the data txt file (Krazy-Kreatures-Beta-Kreatures.txt). Even when omitting the 
eof test statement, the program isn't running like it's expected to, unlike its alpha counter-part (which is a 
direct copy and paste from its alpha).
UPDATE: Had to remove a "cin.ignore()" statement at the end of the "read_kreature" function that was hindering the 
program to continue running. NEW PROBLEM, data file is not being read currently. Might be because the data file
is possibly not even in the beta branch.

FIX: Found out that it was a minor user error on my part, where I mispelled the name of the file in the 
beta_release.cpp file. 

BUG: Trying to separate Kreatures in data file with endls, however running into issue where file isn't being
read properly, thus not outputting expected outcomes. Tried using "cin.ignore()", didn't work.

FIX: In "read_kreature" function, I added a temporary string variable to read the endl into with "getline"
